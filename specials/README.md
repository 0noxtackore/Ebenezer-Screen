# Specials Module 🌟

Special presentations module for songs, readings, announcements and other non‑standard content.

## Purpose

The Specials module provides a flexible canvas for content that does not fit strictly into Bible, Hymns or Messages, such as:

- Special songs or solos
- Scripture readings outside the usual flow
- Announcements or service information
- Event‑specific slides

## Files

- **`specials.js`** – Logic for loading and switching between special slides or texts
- **`specials.css`** – Visual styles for titles, subtitles and body text (scaled for 1920p / 4K / 8K)

## Features

- Title, subtitle and body text areas with strong visual hierarchy
- Cinematic backgrounds consistent with the rest of the application
- Large typography tuned for ultra‑high‑resolution projectors
- Suitable for both short texts and slightly longer paragraphs

## Typical Usage

- Configure one or more "special" items (song lyrics, announcements, readings)
- Use Specials during specific moments in the service
- Return to Bible, Hymns, Messages or Rest via the usual navigation controls
