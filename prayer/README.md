# Prayer Module 🙏

Interactive prayer module for guided and free‑form prayer sessions.

## Files

- **`prayer.js`** – Logic for guided prayer flows and state handling
- **`prayer.css`** – Contemplative visual styles and typography

## Status

🚧 **In development** – UI and flows are being refined and extended.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Predefined written prayers (e.g. themes such as thanksgiving, intercession, worship)
- [ ] Free‑form prayer mode with simple text anchors
- [ ] Prayer timer for focused time blocks
- [ ] Contemplative backgrounds suitable for projection
- [ ] Optional soft background music
- [ ] Integration with voice commands through the Speaker module

## Planned Voice Commands (Spanish)

```text
"Oración"
"Padre Nuestro"
"Orar"
```

The expectation is that voice commands will be able to open the prayer view and, in time, select specific prayer presets.
